The Urban Collaborative Project (UCP) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization serving the historically redlined community of Southeast San Diego (SESD) since 2013. UCP works to connect residents to upstream services and resources through various action teams and strategic partnerships between community members and key stakeholders. Utilizing a Self-Healing Community Model, UCP empowers local residents to identify their neighborhood issues and address challenges together by using data and developing innovative resident-led projects. By using data, our teams create action plans, outreach, and solutions designed to address disparities focusing on health, housing, transportation, art, and infrastructure. Whether it is advocating for equitable distribution of resources or finding ways to improve delivery systems, UCP’s “community healing process” is designed to build capacity by encouraging, training, and supporting local residents to identify and solve their community’s issues together.
